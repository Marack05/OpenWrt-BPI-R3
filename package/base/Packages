Description:  takes a list of prefixes in conventional format on stdin, and performs two
 optimisations to reduce the length of the prefix list. It removes any
 supplied prefixes which are supurfluous because they are already included in
 another supplied prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 would be removed if
 203.97.0.0/17 was also supplied), and identifies adjacent prefixes that can
 be combined under a single, shorter-length prefix (e.g., 203.97.2.0/24 and
 203.97.3.0/24 can be combined into the single prefix 203.97.2.0/23).

Description:  Alarm Pinger (apinger) is a little tool which monitors various IP devices by
 simple ICMP echo requests. There are various other tools, that can do this,
 but most of them are shell or perl scripts, spawning many processes, thus much
 CPU-expensive, especially when one wants continuous monitoring and fast
 response on target failure.  Alarm Pinger is a single program written in C, so
 it doesn't need much CPU power even when monitoring many targets with frequent
 probes.  Alarm Pinger supports both IPv4 and IPv6. The code have been tested
 on Linux and FreeBSD.

 intervals, it shows system-level activity related to the
 CPU, memory, swap, disks (including LVM) and network
 layers, and for every process (and thread) it shows e.g.
 the CPU utilization, memory growth, disk utilization,
 priority, username, state, and exit code. In combination
 with the optional kernel module netatop, it even shows
 network activity per process/thread.

Description:  This program forwards DHCP messages between subnets with different sublayer
 broadcast domains. It is similarly to the DHCP relay agent dhcrelay of ISC's
 DHCP, but has the following features which are important for me:
 
 - Runs as non-root in a chroot-jail
 - Uses "normal" AF_INET sockets; this allows to uses packetfilters to filter
 incoming messages.
 - The DHCP agent IDs can be defined freely
 - Has a small memory footprint when using dietlibc
 
 It tries to be RFC 2131/2132 and 3046 compliant. Probably it works with BOOTP
 (RFC 951) also, but since the handling of the giaddr field is described
 misleading (see RFC 1542), there may occur problems.

 a user-defined program, such as a spam filter, which can drop,
 re-address or edit messages as they pass through. When running
 as a store-and-forward MTA incoming messages are stored in a
 local spool directory, and then forwarded to the next SMTP
 server on request.

Description:  Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization
 (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables.  This mechanism requires only a
 single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of
 information including desired access through an iptables policy. The main
 application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
 protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
 make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
 more difficult.
 This package contains the fwknop daemon.

Description:  The Go programming language is an open source project to make
 programmers more productive.
 
 Go is expressive, concise, clean, and efficient. Its concurrency
 mechanisms make it easy to write programs that get the most out of
 multicore and networked machines, while its novel type system enables
 flexible and modular program construction. Go compiles quickly to
 machine code yet has the convenience of garbage collection and the power
 of run-time reflection. It's a fast, statically typed, compiled language
 that feels like a dynamically typed, interpreted language.
 
 This package provides the Go programming language source files needed
 for cross-compilation.

Description:  Avahi is an mDNS/DNS-SD (aka RendezVous/Bonjour/ZeroConf)
 implementation (library). It facilitates
 service discovery on a local network -- this means that
 you can plug your laptop or computer into a network and
 instantly be able to view other people who you can chat with,
 find printers to print to or find files being shared.
 This kind of technology is already found in MacOS X
 (branded 'Rendezvous', 'Bonjour' and sometimes 'ZeroConf')
 and is very convenient.
 .
 The libavahi package contains the mDNS/DNS-SD shared libraries,
 used by other programs. Specifically, it provides
 libavahi-core and libavahi-common libraries.
 .
 The libavahi-dbus-support package enables
 D-Bus support in avahi, needed to support
 the libavahi-client library and avahi-utils.
 .
 Selecting this package modifies the build configuration
 so that avahi packages are built with support for D-BUS enabled;
 it does not generate a separate binary of its own.
 It also automatically adds the D-Bus package to the build.
 libavahi-dbus-support is selected automatically if you select
 libavahi-client or avahi-utils.

Description:  Libconfig is a simple library for manipulating structured configuration
 files. This file format is more compact and more readable than XML. And
 unlike XML, it is type-aware, so it is not necessary to do string
 parsing in application code.
 
 Libconfig is very compact -- just 38K for the stripped C shared
 library (less than one-fourth the size of the expat XML parser library)
 and 66K for the stripped C++ shared library. This makes it well-suited
 for memory-constrained systems like handheld devices.

Description:  libdaemon is a lightweight C library that eases the writing of UNIX daemons.
 It consists of the following parts:
 - A wrapper around fork() which does the correct daemonization procedure of a process
 - A wrapper around syslog() for simpler and compatible log output to Syslog or STDERR
 - An API for writing PID files
 - An API for serializing UNIX signals into a pipe for usage with select() or poll()
 - An API for running subprocesses with STDOUT and STDERR redirected to syslog
 
 APIs like these are used in most daemon software available. It is not that
 simple to get it done right and code duplication is not a goal.

Description:  The libffi library provides a portable, high level programming interface to
 various calling conventions. This allows a programmer to call any function
 specified by a call interface description at run-time.
 
 FFI stands for Foreign Function Interface. A foreign function interface is the
 popular name for the interface that allows code written in one language to call
 code written in another language. The libffi library really only provides the
 lowest, machine dependent layer of a fully featured foreign function interface.
 A layer must exist above libffi that handles type conversions for values passed
 between the two languages.

Description:  Fwknop implements an authorization scheme known as Single Packet Authorization
 (SPA) for Linux systems running iptables.  This mechanism requires only a
 single encrypted and non-replayed packet to communicate various pieces of
 information including desired access through an iptables policy. The main
 application of this program is to use iptables in a default-drop stance to
 protect services such as SSH with an additional layer of security in order to
 make the exploitation of vulnerabilities (both 0-day and unpatched code) much
 more difficult.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains a shared library, used by other programs.

Description:  NaCl (pronounced "salt") is a new easy-to-use high-speed software library for network communication, encryption, decryption, signatures, etc.
 NaCl's goal is to provide all of the core operations needed to build higher-level cryptographic tools.
 Sodium is a portable, cross-compilable, installable, packageable fork of NaCl (based on the latest released upstream version nacl-20110221), with a compatible API.
 The design choices, particularly in regard to the Curve25519 Diffie-Hellman function, emphasize security (whereas NIST curves emphasize "performance" at the cost of security), and "magic constants" in NaCl/Sodium have clear rationales.
 The same cannot be said of NIST curves, where the specific origins of certain constants are not described by the standards.
 And despite the emphasis on higher security, primitives are faster across-the-board than most implementations of the NIST standards.

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.

Description:  mksh is the MirBSD enhanced version of the Public Domain Korn
 shell (pdksh), a Bourne-compatible shell which is largely si-
 milar to the original AT&T Korn shell; mksh is the only pdksh
 derivate currently being actively developed.  It includes bug
 fixes and feature improvements, in order to produce a modern,
 robust shell good for interactive and especially script use.
 mksh has UTF-8 support (in substring operations and the Emacs
 editing mode) and - while R59 corresponds to OpenBSD 5.7-cur-
 rent ksh (without GNU bash-like PS1 and fancy character clas-
 ses) - adheres to SUSv4 and is much more robust. The code has
 been cleaned up and simplified, bugs fixed, standards compli-
 ance added, and several enhancements (for extended compatibi-
 lity to other modern shells - as well as a couple of its own)
 are available. It has sensible defaults as usual with BSD.

Description:  procps is a set of command line and full-screen utilities that provide information out of the pseudo-filesystem
 most commonly located at /proc. This filesystem provides a simple interface to the kernel data structures.
 The programs of procps generally concentrate on the structures that describe the processess running on the system.
 
 NOTE: some utilities provided by procps-ng packages (ps, uptime, kill, ...) are installed as busybox applets, by default.
 Conflicting applets should be removed from the build to avoid file conflicts.

Description:  This tool can be described as a Tiny, Dirty, Linux-and-OSX-Only
 C command that looks for coreutils basic commands (cp, mv, dd, tar,
 gzip/gunzip, cat, etc.) currently running on your system and
 displays the percentage of copied data. It can also show estimated
 time and throughput, and provide a "top-like" mode (monitoring).
 .
 It simply scans `/proc` for interesting commands, and then looks at
 directories `fd` and `fdinfo` to find opened files and seek positions,
 and reports status for the largest file.
 .
 It's very light, and compatible with virtually any command.
 This program was formerly known as 'cv' on github.

Description:  The Radicale Project is a CalDAV (calendar) and CardDAV (contact) server. It aims to be a light solution, easy to use, easy to install, easy to configure. As a consequence, it requires few software dependances and is pre-configured to work out-of-the-box.
 
 The Radicale Project runs on most of the UNIX-like platforms (Linux, BSD, MacOS X) and Windows. It is known to work with Evolution, Lightning, iPhone and Android clients. It is free and open-source software, released under GPL version 3.
 
 This package contains the python files.
 
 Note that md5 encryption of passwords requires passlib, and
 bcrypt encryption requires passlib + bcrypt.  These are not
 added as hard dependencies as users may be running radicale2
 with a web server doing the authentication instead of radicale2.

Description:  RRD is the Acronym for Round Robin Database. RRD is a system to store and
 display time-series data (i.e. network bandwidth, machine-room temperature,
 server load average). It stores the data in a very compact way that will
 not expand over time, and it presents useful graphs by processing the data
 to enforce a certain data density. It can be used either via simple wrapper
 scripts (from shell or Perl) or via frontends that poll network devices and
 put friendly user interface on it.
 
 This is version 1.0.x with cgilib-0.4, gd1.3 and libpng-1.0.9 linked into
 librrd.so. The library is much smaller compared to the 1.2.x version with
 separate dynamic linked libraries.
 This package contains command line tools used to manage RRDs.

Description:  libv4l is a collection of libraries which adds a thin abstraction layer on
 top of video4linux2 devices. The purpose of this (thin) layer is to make it
 easy for application writers to support a wide variety of devices without
 having to write separate code for different devices in the same class. libv4l
 consists of 3 different libraries: libv4lconvert, libv4l1 and libv4l2.
 
 libv4l1 offers the (deprecated) v4l1 API on top of v4l2 devices, independent
 of the drivers for those devices supporting v4l1 compatibility (which many
 v4l2 drivers do not).
 
 libv4l2 offers the v4l2 API on top of v4l2 devices, while adding for the
 application transparent libv4lconvert conversion where necessary.
 This package contains the video4linux utilities.
