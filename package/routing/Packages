Description:  Ahcpd is a daemon for configuring an IPv6 network using the Ad-Hoc
 Configuration Protocol (AHCP).  AHCP is designed for wireless mesh
 networks, where IPv6 autoconfiguration and DHCPv6 do not work, but may
 also be used on wired networks.

Description:  alfred is a user space daemon for distributing arbitrary local information
 over the mesh/network in a decentralized fashion. This data can be anything
 which appears to be useful - originally designed to replace the batman-adv
 visualization (vis), you may distribute hostnames, phone books, administration
 information, DNS information, the local weather forecast ...
 
 alfred runs as daemon in the background of the system. A user may insert
 information by using the alfred binary on the command line, or use special
 programs to communicate with alfred (done via unix sockets). alfred then takes
 care of distributing the local information to other alfred servers on other
 nodes. This is done via IPv6 link-local multicast, and does not require any
 configuration. A user can request data from alfred, and will receive the
 information available from all alfred servers in the network.

Description:  Babel is a loop-avoiding distance-vector routing protocol for IPv6 and IPv4
 with fast convergence properties. It is based on the ideas in DSDV, AODV and
 Cisco's EIGRP, but is designed to work well not only in wired networks but
 also in wireless mesh networks, and has been extended with support for
 overlay networks. Babel is in the process of becoming an IETF Standard.

Description:  Mesh11sd is a dynamic parameter configuration daemon for 802.11s mesh networks.
 It was originally designed to leverage 802.11s mesh networking at Captive Portal venues.
 This is the open source version and it enables easy and automated mesh network operation with multiple mesh nodes.
 It allows all mesh parameters supported by the wireless driver to be set in the uci config file.
 Settings take effect immediately without having to restart the wireless network.
 Default settings give rapid and reliable layer 2 mesh convergence.
 Without mesh11sd, many mesh parameters cannot be set in the uci wireless config file as the mesh interface must be up before the parameters can be set.
 Some of those that are supported, would fail to be implemented when the network is (re)started resulting in errors or dropped nodes.
 The mesh11sd daemon dynamically checks configured parameters and sets them as required.
 This version does not require a Captive Portal to be running.

Description:  openNDS is a Captive Portal solution that offers an instant way to provide restricted access to the Internet.
 With little or no configuration, a dynamically generated and adaptive splash page sequence is automatically served.
 Both client driven Captive Portal Detection (CPD) and gateway driven Captive Portal Identification (CPI - RFC 8910 and RFC 8908) are supported.
 Internet access is granted by either a click to continue button, or after credential verification as a result of filling in a login form.
 The package incorporates the FAS API allowing many flexible customisation options.
 The creation of sophisticated third party authentication applications is fully supported.
 Internet hosted https portals can be implemented with no security errors, to inspire maximum user confidence.
 This release requires iptables(legacy)
